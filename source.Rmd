The state of West Bengal was created with the partition of India in 1947. Before obtaining independence from the British Raj in 1947, West Bengal was a part of the state of Bengal. Later, it was bifurcated and West Bengal and East Pakistan were formed. The diverse demography of West Bengal, erstwhile Bengal, was first enumerated in 1872. It was the first attempt at anything like a systematic enumeration of the people in that part of India. 

It has to be noted that data prior to the partition of India pertains to that of the united state of Bengal. After 1947, the data is on West Bengal, India only. Since the state has undergone major geographic changes before, this text focuses on the history of population of West Bengal after it was created in 1947 with India's independence and partition to keep the data comparable. 

The first census of West Bengal after its inception was conducted in 1951 and the last being in 2011. Every ten years, the census of West Bengal is conducted as a part of the Census of India. As per the Census of India, 2011, West Bengal is the $4^{th}$ largest state of India in terms of its population.

The following table summarizes the total population of West Bengal as recorded in the census of the corresponding years.
